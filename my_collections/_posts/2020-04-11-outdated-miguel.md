Electronic devices are already used in medicine to treat some medical conditions. One important factor that has been limitting the usage of more devices is the fact that they need to be charged and charging them could implicate invasive procedures. This hydrogel, although it is still in a development phase, could revolutionize this area as it's capable of generating energy and charging batteries under the influence of ultrasounds.
