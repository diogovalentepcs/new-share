The youth unemployment rate stood at 14,2% all across the EU in August 2019, being more prominent in the south. In order to reduce this number, there are initiatives like Youth Guarantee, which aims to open up the job market for young people. However, besides the lack of information about it, the scheme has also been criticised for focusing too much on non full time employment. To control these issues, the education system and social services should be improved, as well as the access to information in employment centres.
