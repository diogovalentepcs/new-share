The automotive and the construction industries have encountered radical evolution throughout the last decades. With the goal to innovate even more, a group of European scientists created a hybrid between a robot and a 3D printer, that is proven to be 40% faster and 25% more productive than the traditional manufacturing methods. In addition, this technology is now ready to be implemented in other sectors, such as the aeronautical, the shipyard and the renewable energy sector.
