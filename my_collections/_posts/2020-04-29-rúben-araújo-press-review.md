Google's DeepMind, a machine-learning research unit, has managed to develop AI systems able to learn several games entirely by themselves, with no human input besides for their basic rules. AlphaZero, the chess variant of these AI systems, managed to master the game by playing against itself in less than 4 hours, immediatly becoming the most powerful chess engine in the world! Is it possible these systems could help us resolve serious real world problems?!
