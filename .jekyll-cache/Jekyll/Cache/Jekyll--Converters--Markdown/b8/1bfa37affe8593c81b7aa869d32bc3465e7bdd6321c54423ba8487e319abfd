I"<p>Rare diseases affect 10% of the global population, and consume an enormous amount of healthcare resources. Although there are several teams spread across the global researching in order to obtain a cure as soon as possible, lacks of communication among those teams leads to a huge amount of time and resources wasted. Since 80% of those diseases are due to genetic causes, superstructures called “federated database systems” can help to gather all the genomic data for rare diseases available, while assuring data privacy.</p>
