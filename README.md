# ShARE UP

share-up.pt is the website for ShARE UP. It is compiled through jekyll, that renders static pages from markdown (.md) files. To edit the content, ONLY change these .md files.

## Usage
There are 2 ways to update the website. By changing the content (.md, img, etc.) or by changing the design (.css / .html / .js). 

To change the images go to /img folder and choose the folder you want to change. Take note that only the backgroung image needs to be of high quality, all others should be squared and with a mx size of 500x500px, to improve load speeds
