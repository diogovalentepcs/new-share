In order to reduce this number, there are initiatives like Youth Guarantee, which aims to open up the job market for young people. However, besides the lack of information about it, the scheme has also been criticised for focusing too much on non full time employment. To control these issues, the education system and social services should be improved, as well as the access to information in employment centres.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sofia Dias</name></author><summary type="html">The youth unemployment rate stood at 14,2% all across the EU in August 2019, being more prominent in the south.

With the goal to innovate even more, a group of European scientists created a hybrid between a robot and a 3D printer, that is proven to be 40% faster and 25% more productive than the traditional manufacturing methods. In addition, this technology is now ready to be implemented in other sectors, such as the aeronautical, the shipyard and the renewable energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Juliana Rodrigues</name></author><summary type="html">The automotive and the construction industries have encountered radical evolution throughout the last decades.
