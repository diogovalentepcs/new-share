One important factor that has been limitting the usage of more devices is the fact that they need to be charged and charging them could implicate invasive procedures. This hydrogel, although it is still in a development phase, could revolutionize this area as it’s capable of generating energy and charging batteries under the influence of ultrasounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rúben Pinto</name></author><summary type="html">Electronic devices are already used in medicine to treat some medical conditions.

Although there are several teams spread across the global researching in order to obtain a cure as soon as possible, lacks of communication among those teams leads to a huge amount of time and resources wasted. Since 80% of those diseases are due to genetic causes, superstructures called “federated database systems” can help to gather all the genomic data for rare diseases available, while assuring data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Miguel Ferreira</name></author><summary type="html">Rare diseases affect 10% of the global population, and consume an enormous amount of healthcare resources.
